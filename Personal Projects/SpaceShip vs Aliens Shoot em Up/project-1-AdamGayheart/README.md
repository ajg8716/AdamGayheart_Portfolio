Unique movement system to add complexity to gameplay, wave-based system for enemy spawns.

I created a shield powerup, however when one is spawned Unity freezes/ crashes.

## Sources
Assets created by myself

## Known Issues
 shield powerup is bugged and will crash if spawns so i have left the spawn script uncalled but all elements of the object are in the project
 entities dont change to red when hit even though code is implemented to do so

### Requirements not completed
the shield does not work properly
entities don't change color when hit
