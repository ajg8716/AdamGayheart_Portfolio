Name: Adam Gayheart

## Game Design

-   Camera Orientation: _How are the art assets viewed from? (ie. topdown or side)_Top Down
-   Camera Movement: _How does the camera move in your game? (if at all)_Static Camera
-   Player Health: _How are you handling player health? (healthbar, lives, ?)_Player will have 3 hearts, hearts will disappear as player is shot by enemies
-   End Condition: _How does a game/round/level end? Player Dies_
-   Scoring: _How does the player earn points in your game? By killing the enemies_

### Game Description

You are an intergalactic starfighter pilot fighting off enemy, alien spacecraft that want to kill you. Using your expert piloting skills and plasma cannons, take out the onslaught of enemies. 

### Controls

-   Movement
    - Rotate Clockwise: D key
	- Rotate Counter-Clockwise: A key
	- Move Ship Forward: W key
-   Fire: Left Mouse Button

## My Own Additions

- Unique movement system to add complexity to gameplay.
- Wave-based system for enemy spawns.

## Sources

- Assets created by myself.

## Known Issues

- shield powerup is bugged and will crash if it spawns so I have left the spawn script uncalled but all elements of the object are in the project

- entities do not change to red when hit even though code is implemented to do so.
