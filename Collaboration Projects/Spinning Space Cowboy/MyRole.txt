## My Role For This Project

in this project my role was creating and implementing assets for the player, enemies, and other obstacles.

## Classes I Created
- PLayer.cs
- Enemies.cs
- Bullet.cs
- Barriers.cs

## What I did in Each Class I worked on

- Player.cs: I created all code for this class

- Enemies.cs: I created all code for this class

- Bullet.cs: I created the constructor and Draw methods for this class as well as collaborated on the Update and Move methods

- Barriers.cs: I created all code for this class, it is read for implementation however was not implemented due to time constraints and prioritizatoon of other elements of the project for the turn-in.

- Game1.cs: I worked heavily on the LoadContent method to implement all game objects for the scenes. I also created all FSM logic for state changes within the game. I created code for key presses and what they do. I collaborated with my teammates on collision detection and what happens when it happens. I collaborated on the aiming and shooting mechanics for the player as well as recoil movement.
